# Into-the-Dark
This is the official "Into the Dark" Github Page! On this page you'll find progress on how the game is doing updates and most importantly the game itself, but you'll also find a way to hellp with the game yourself! you could be apart of this awesome game, imagine that! I'll give some information about the game, The game is a Third Person Horror Game, some insparation was taken from popular Video Games, such as; Resident Evil, Bendy And The Ink Machine, and Outlast. You'll come to find that this game has the potential of being very good, I've been very excited for the Demo Release of the game hopefully coming out December 10th, 2024. I'm going to post a google doc of the development details very soon. Into the Dark is being made in Godot 3.6.beta3 so thats cool. It's also the google play release, as I am working on chromebook. I know, how professional. But I'm working with what I got. You'll also probably see concept art posted on here too, if not then you'll see it on my deviantart page, which I'll try an link. If i can that is. Another thing this game is not far into development, like at all... So there is still time for people to volunteer (since this is a volunteer job there is no pay). lastly this is my first game so please feel free to give feedback or give coding advice, or any advice for a matter of fact. Anyways that's all peace!
